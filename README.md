# DQXIHook

DQXIHook is a DLL hook for Dragon Quest XI, which allows the game to load unpackaged files from disk, and also enables use of the UE4 developer console.

More info can be found on the release thread: https://steamcommunity.com/app/742120/discussions/0/1732087825006394099/

While this hook is created for DQXI it should be portable to other UE4 games, although UE4 versions newer than the one DQXI uses (4.13) may need extra changes to enable the console.
