# DQXIHook

DQXIHook is a DLL hook for Dragon Quest XI, which allows the game to load unpackaged files from disk, and also enables use of the UE4 developer console.

More info can be found on the release thread: https://steamcommunity.com/app/742120/discussions/0/1732087825006394099/

While this hook is created for DQXI it should be portable to other UE4 games (in fact, the method used here for both console & loose-file loading still seem to work even on latest UE versions!)
